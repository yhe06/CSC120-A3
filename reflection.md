Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Michaela and Elizabeth.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    Sunday 7-9 in Ford 215, Monday 7-9 in Ford 215 as well. Monday was very helpful.
    Sunday, the tutor helped me implement the transcript part of the assignment.
    Monday helped me realize that I should split the string into an array list and loop it. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Starting the assignment: I am confused. Confused on whether or not to implement utility random. Need to refresh on Python basics and thinking to implement into Java. Confused about all these objects to call. 

    Ending the assignment: I like Java... I think! I think, it is a challenge to think "object-orientedly" and I like challenges, when I am not stressing to get it done.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    Similarities include concepts like arrays are similar to lists, and if, else, else if statements are similar. The syntax is really differnet like I can't ask "if "so and so" in "so and so"" I have to do like string.contains("so and so") instead. Or when you're trying access an index in a list, you have to do .get(i) and that's for ArrayLists only and other objects would have different methods, it's a lot to figure out.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    A lot of things I tried did not work... very stressful assignment. I had to look up a lot of things regarding Java syntax. I tried to have conditional statements without a loop at first, and it was causing me errors. Then I started using a loop and it helped! Advice for someone taking this course in the future is TO STAAARTTT EARLLYY!!! Go to TA sessions is another advice, because there will be other students in the same class struggling alongside you which is helpful. 

    What currently doesn't work is the me/I dilemma. Maybe I will come back to this assignment and figure it out. Additionally. Two punctuations in a sentence throws off my capitalization in the program, but that is something I might also come back to.
