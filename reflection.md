Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Michaela and Elizabeth.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    Sunday 7-9 in Ford 215, Monday 7-9 in Ford 215 as well. Monday was very helpful.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    I am confused. Confused on whether or not to implement utility random. Need to refresh on Python basics and thinking to implement into Java. Confused about all these objects to call.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    Similarities include concepts like arrays are similar to lists, and if, else, else if statements are similar. The syntax is really differnet like I can't ask "if "so and so" in "so and so"" I have to do like string.contains("so and so") instead. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    A lot of things I tried did not work... very stressful assignment. I had to look up a lot of things regarding Java syntax. I tried to have conditional statements without a loop at first, and it was causing me errors. Then I started using a loop and it helped! Advice for someone taking this course in the future is TO STAAARTTT EARLLYY!!!
